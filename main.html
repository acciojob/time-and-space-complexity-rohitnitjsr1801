	 <h1>Understanding Time and Space Complexity</h1>
    <p>
        Time complexity is a computational concept that describes the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the size of its input. Understanding time complexity is crucial for developing efficient algorithms, as it helps in predicting how an algorithm will perform as the input size grows.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses in relation to the size of its input. It is an important consideration alongside time complexity. An algorithm with a space complexity of O(n) means that the memory required grows linearly with the input size.
